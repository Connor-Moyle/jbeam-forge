## Phase log

### Phase 1 — Foundations (done 2026-09-26)

**Delivered**
- **Scaffold:** electron-vite (main/preload/renderer), Electron 44, React 19, TS 5.9 strict, Vite 7.
  - The renderer is sandboxed with context isolation and a strict CSP. `window.open` and navigation are blocked, and all permission requests are denied.
  - A typed IPC contract (`src/shared/ipc-contract.ts`) drives both the preload allowlist and the main handlers. Handlers check the sender and validate requests with zod.
- **Design system:**
  - `tokens.css`: every §4.17 token.
  - `tokens.ts`: typed access plus numeric resolution for three.js, Lucide and Radix.
  - `scripts/lint-tokens.mjs`: fails `npm run lint` on any hardcoded colour, size, duration or easing.
- **Component kit** (Radix primitives underneath): Button, IconButton, Input, NumberInput, Select, Checkbox, Toggle, Slider, Tabs, CollapsibleSection, TreeRow, Modal, Popover, Tooltip, Badge, Callout, ScrollArea, EmptyState. A dev-only Component Kit panel renders them all.
- **Logging and errors (§3.6):**
  - electron-log in main and renderer: 5 MB rotation, scoped loggers, persisted debug toggle.
  - Workers log through `logBridge` + `attachWorkerLogRelay`.
  - Global error hooks in main, renderer and workers. IPC failures are logged.
  - Root and per-panel ErrorBoundary. The error card offers copy diagnostics, reload and reset layout.
  - Guarded render loop and WebGL context-loss recovery.
  - Help menu: Open Log Folder, Copy Diagnostic Info, Debug Logging.
- **Shell:**
  - dockview themed from tokens with 32 px headers.
  - 40 px grouped toolbar. Actions from later phases are shown inert with a "coming in phase N" tooltip.
  - 26 px mono status bar with a sliding status message.
  - Presets Modelling / Materials / Testing, defined as data.
  - Layout persisted to `userData/layouts/current.json` (debounced, atomic), with fallback when a stored layout is corrupt or has unknown panels.
  - Viewport placeholder (three.js grid).
- **`.jbforge`:** zod schema v1 containing every §2 section, a migration runner, and deterministic serialization. Also a frozen fixture `tests/fixtures/jbforge/v1-empty.jbforge`, and `project:read`/`project:write` IPC. Writes are atomic and validated first.
- **Zustand discipline:** `EMPTY_ARR`/`EMPTY_OBJ`, `docs/zustand-rules.md`, and a custom ESLint rule `forge/no-fresh-selector-fallback`. react-hooks rules are errors.
- **Tooling:**
  - vitest: node + jsdom projects, 125 tests, snapshots for the project, settings and layout writers.
  - ESLint 9 with type-checked rules.
  - `npm run run-desktop`: Playwright Electron harness with 7 scenarios, screenshots in `artifacts/run-desktop/`. It fails on any unexpected console error or `[error]` line in main.log.

**Code review fixes** (`/code-review`, before commit):
- A second launch now exits before any startup: no settings load, IPC or window.
- Viewport remounts release their WebGL context (`forceContextLoss`), and the WebGL probe context is released and cached. A harness scenario (24 preset switches) proves Chromium's context cap is never hit. It failed before the fix.
- `SettingsService.update` persists before adopting the new value. A failed write leaves memory, listeners and the Debug Logging checkbox on the saved value.
- `NumberInput`: Enter without an edit no longer re-rounds the value.
- The review also flagged the CSP blocking React Refresh in dev. `npm run dev` was run and rendered normally, so no change.

**Verification:** `npm run typecheck` ✔ · `npm run lint` ✔ · `npm test` 127/127 ✔ · `npm run run-desktop` 8/8 ✔ (shell, kit, presets, panel-crash isolation, WebGL loss + fatal loop, WebGL context churn, worker logging, layout persistence across relaunch). Single-instance behaviour was checked manually. No in-game gate: export output is unchanged.

**Next:** Phase 2 — Ground truth (BeamNG install-dir setting, `npm run study-vehicle`, docs/ format notes, lenient jbeam parser + serializer with snapshot/round-trip tests).

## Known issues

- **Repo file layout (needs the user):** root `SPEC.md` and `docs/SPEC.md` both contain the Claude Code project instructions, which belong in `CLAUDE.md`. The full rebuild spec is at `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\SPEC.md` and needs copying to `docs/SPEC.md`. Both files were left out of the Phase 1 commit until this is fixed.
- **npm 11 allow-scripts:** `package.json` → `allowScripts` approves Electron and esbuild. A `postinstall` (`install-electron`) fetches the Electron binary on a fresh clone.
- **Renderer bundle is ~3 MB** (three.js, Radix, dockview). That's acceptable for a desktop app. Revisit with code-splitting if startup becomes slow.
- The `project:*` IPC channels accept any absolute `*.jbforge` path. Phase 3 should route paths through native dialogs.
- The toolbar's Settings button is inert until Phase 2 adds the settings UI (install dir).
